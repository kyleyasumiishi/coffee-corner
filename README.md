## About

I built this product landing page as one of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Projects.

freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone.

#### Product Landing Page User Stories

- User Story #1: My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".
- User Story #2: I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company - logo would make a good image here.
- User Story #3: Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
- User Story #4: I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class - nav-link.
- User Story #5: When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of - the landing page.

- User Story #7: My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".
- User Story #8: Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
- User Story #9: The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
- User Story #10: The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email - address.

## New Web Development Concepts Learned

My goal for each freeCodeCamp project is simply to learn about and practice using new web development concepts and techniques.

Here's are new concepts I learned and practiced by building this project:

- HTML <code>nav</code> element
- Link to internal sections of a page with <code>anchor</code> elements
- Embedding a YouTube video in a webpage witih the HTML <code>iframe</code> element
- Create a CSS Grid and add columns with <code>grid-template-columns</code> and rows with <code>grid-template-rows</code>
- Create a CSS3 Media Query to change the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes
- Add a stickily positioned navbar element combined with the <code>top</code> CSS property to make the navbar always appear at the top of the viewport
